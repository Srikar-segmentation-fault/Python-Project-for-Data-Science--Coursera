# 📊 Final Data Science Project – Python for Data Science

This project is the final assignment for the **IBM Python for Data Science** course on Coursera. The notebook demonstrates foundational data science techniques using Python, including data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and real-world data extraction through web scraping.

## 📁 File

* `python project for data science final assignment.ipynb`: Main notebook covering the final assignment tasks and solutions.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

* pandas
* numpy
* BeautifulSoup
* Plotly
* yfinance
* requests

## 🚀 Key Sections in the Notebook

1. **Web Scraping** – Using `requests` and HTML parsing with `BeautifulSoup` to extract real-world data from websites.
2. **Loading the Dataset** – Reading structured data using `pandas` from CSV or web sources.
3. **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Inspecting data structure, handling null values, and deriving statistical summaries.
4. **Data Cleaning** – Filtering, transforming, and cleaning data for analysis.
5. **Data Visualization** – Creating interactive and static plots using Plotly.
6. **Data Aggregation & Insights** – Summarizing datasets to find key patterns and trends.
